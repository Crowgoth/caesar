# Python practice - Caesar cipher

Here is the link for [Wikipedia-Link Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Possible assignments:

- ask for the shift of the cipher to the regular alphabet and creating the cipher.
- ask if the message shoud be encrypted or decrypted.
- write a function for encrypting the characters of a cleartext-input. Make it case insensitive (upper case letters) and remove all non-aplabetical characters
- write a funtion to decrypt the encrypted text, to get the cleartext back.

Example:
```
How many characters should the alphabet be shifted (1-25): 3
Alphabet:         ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Shifted alphabet: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt a message? e

Please enter message: Hello World!
Processed message: KHOORZRUOG
```
