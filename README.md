# Python practice - Caesar cipher

Here is the link for [Wikipedia-Link Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Possible assignments:

- ask for the shift of the cipher to the regular alphabet and creating the cipher.
- write a function for encrypting the characters of a cleartext-input. Make it case insensitive (upper case letters) to make encryption easier.
- write a funtion to decrypt the encrypted text, to get the cleartext back.
- ask for a cleartext-input, check that the cleartext consists of only letters
