# Python practice - Caesar cipher

This is a practice assignment for early python programming. It can include string-operations, functions, input. It is also a first practice run for learning git/ github and writing this Readme-file in Markdown.

The assignment is to write a program to encrypt or decrypt messages using a Caesar-cipher.

Here is the [Wikipedia link - Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).


Possible tasks:

- ask for the shift of the cipher to the regular alphabet and create the cipher.
- ask if the message shoud be encrypted or decrypted.
- write a function for encrypting the characters of a cleartext-input. Make it case insensitive (upper case letters) and remove all non-alphabetical characters
- write a function to decrypt the encrypted text, to get the cleartext back.


Example:
```
How many characters should the alphabet be shifted (1-25): 3
Alphabet:         ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Shifted alphabet: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt a message? e

Please enter message: Hello World!
Processed message: KHOORZRUOG
